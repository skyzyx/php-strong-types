Enables strong types for PHP. This allows for tighter validation, especially when accepting input from users.


## Examples

{Fill-in: Example usage of this code.}


## Features

* Boolean
* Collection (ArrayAccess)
* Enum
* Float
* Integer
* String (incl. Multibyte)

`DateTime` is already strongly typed, so use that class for strong date/time types.


## Installation

Using [Composer]:
```bash
composer require skyzyx/strong-types=~1.0
```

And include it in your scripts:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```


## Testing

Firstly, run `composer install -o` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [phpDocumentor 2.x](http://phpdoc.org). You should install it locally
on your system with:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin &&
wget http://phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar &&
chmod +x phpDocumentor.phar &&
mv phpDocumentor.phar phpdoc
```

Once it's installed, you can generate updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the
repository.
```bash
phpdoc
```

## Coding Standards

PSR-0/1/2 are a solid foundation, but are not an entire coding style by themselves. I have taken the time to document
all of the nitpicky patterns and nuances of my personal coding style. It goes well-beyond brace placement and tabs vs.
spaces to cover topics such as docblock annotations, ternary operations and which variation of English to use. It aims
for thoroughness and pedanticism over hoping that we can all get along.
